# SoapyLMS7 - SoapySDR bindings for LimeSuite

The SoapyLMS7 wrapper provides SoapySDR bindings for LimeSuite
devices using the LMS7 API. The wrapper builds along side the LimeSuite
compilation when SoapySDR development files are detected.

SoapyLMS7 allows LimeSuite devices to be used in applications
that use the SoapySDR API such as CubicSDR, Pothos, GNURadio, GrOsmosdr.
In addition, the API supports Python and remote access bindings.
