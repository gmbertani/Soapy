    If you don't already have these libararies please install them with
    the following command:
        sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-dev libfftw3-dev libusb-1.0

    If libwxgtk3.0-dev library is not available from your package repositories,
    it is advised to download wxWidgets library directly from 
    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/. Extract the wxWidgets source code archive.
    Open command line interface(terminal) and change working directory into
    wxWidgets source code folder.
        e.g. cd /home/user/Downloads/wxWidgets-3.0
    Then execute the following commands:
        ./configure
        make  #this command can take quite a while depending on your system power
        sudo make install
    After these commands wxWidgets will be installed on your system.
