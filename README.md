# Soapy
SoapySDR distribution patched for build with MingGW under Windows (no MSYS neither Cygwin needed)

**Note**: this is WORK IN PROGRESS. It aims to integrate Echoes (https://sourceforge.net/projects/echoes)
with SoapySDR (https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR/wiki) and could even be left incomplete. It successfully
builds and install in my Win10 pc by launching BUILDALL.bat that builds and installs soapySDR dll, its utilities
and the drivers dll (only rtlsdr currently... work in progress!).

To try it, remember to adjust the paths on the top of BUILDALL.bat first to your environment. On my PC I develop on
drive D: and you probably won't.
